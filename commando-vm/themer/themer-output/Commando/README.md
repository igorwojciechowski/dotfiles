# themer - Commando

## VS Code

Copy (or symlink) the generated package directory into the VS Code extensions directory:

```
cp -R 'VS Code/themer-commando' ~/.vscode/extensions/
```

Then reload or restart VS Code. The generated theme package should be in the list of installed extensions, and "Themer Commando Dark" will be available in the list of themes.
